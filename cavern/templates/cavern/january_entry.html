        <div class="cavern-sub-heading">Did a little bit of cheating...</div>

                <p>I actually had plenty of free time over my winter break to pursue my new year-long commitment. So, I decided to start this shindig a little early.
                I started off just doing some sketches about how I wanted the site to generally look like, as well as what framework I wanted to use, how I wanted to host the site,
                and briefly brainstormed additional projects I wanted to try out. I went a little gungho, however, and finished the site before the new year started. 
                However, there was still the matter of who's hosting the site, as well as preliminary preparation for my next month's project. It's much more ambitious, and 
                so I'm planning on reaping the extra couple of weeks for some refreshers.</p>

        <div class="cavern-sub-heading">A not-so extraordinary amount of time on colors...</div>
        <div class="cavern-sub-section">
                <p>I've noticed that a lot of pleasant-to-look-at websites arrange their cards in rows of 3. I found that interesting and tried messing around with the arrangment of the 
                cards in different combinations but found the dimensions of the cards too small, the spacing cramped, or the website as a whole just simply uncomfortable. I focused on making 
                the site mobile-responsive through the use of flexboxes, however, and so would place the cards in rows of 1 or 2 to maintain a sensible amount of size and padding.</p>

                <p>This is the first time I designed something from the ground up independently. I had no theme to extend, and so had to come up with something myself. It was not difficult for me to settle
                on a general look of the website in terms of font, padding, and employed shapes. However, choosing colors that didn't make the site look like trash. What followed were multiple
                days of me picking different colors, randomizing color placements, and hesitant decision-making. I recruited the help of an artisticly-critical friend who helped me settle on a combination 
                of color choices that didn't make me fidget. In the end, we settled on a pastel color palette, which I found warm and inviting.</p>

        <div class="cavern-sub-heading">Under the hood...</div>
        <div class="cavern-sub-section">
                <p>I decided to use Django for development, the main reason being that I simply love the intuitive and convenient nature of the framework.
                I also hooked the backend up with AWS to gain some exposure on interacting with cloud platforming. I hope that this brief stint 
                can benefit me as my upcoming workplace is all about AWS, and only AWS.</p>

                <p>The website itself took about 6 hours to finish. AWS, however, turned out to be more troublesome than I hoped for. There were a few nuances
                that had me scratching my head for a while, such as the fact that you need to deploy the server with the "--staged" flag in order to tell the 
                elastic-beanstalk CLI to source the code locally, otherwise, it looks at your Git repository. This was incredibly annoying when I was trying to
                fix an issue with the WSGI file, as none of my changes were actually being observed. Nonetheless, with struggle, comes experience. I have gotten
                to familiarize myself with the AWS console, best practices with IAM users and allocating permissions to groups, the different types of instances,
                and setting up/deploying a new website.
                </p>

                <p>I mapped my URLs around terms elicting vibes of undersea exploration (I binged Deadliest Catch this winter break which led me to look up a bunch
                of random things about the ocean on Wiki and it all snowballed from there), and found it to be a small but fun little personal addition to the site. 
                I'll handle the domain some other time so we don't have to see AWS's atrocious default domain name constantly.
